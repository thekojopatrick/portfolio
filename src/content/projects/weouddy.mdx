## The Problem: Static Events, Passive Participation

While building FarmersPortal, I observed a critical gap:
- **Events ≠ Experiences**: Platforms treated events as calendar items, not living moments.
- **No Ownership**: Small communities relied on WhatsApp/Facebook, losing control over their narratives.
- **Privacy Tradeoffs**: Public events went viral, private ones felt isolated.

Most users comment: "I want to relive the concert vibe, not just see photos later"

## What We Built: Real-Time Event Engagement

### Core Features (Implemented)
1. **Dynamic Event Creation**  
   - Public/private events with granular permissions (SSE encryption for private groups)
   - Media-rich posts: Photos, videos, text (IPFS storage for scalability)

2. **Live Interaction Engine**  
   - Supabase Realtime for instant updates (messages, likes, shares)
   - Presence indicators showing active participants

3. **Community-Centric Design**  
   - Role-based access controls (admins/moderators/participants)
   - Reporting system to maintain community guidelines

**Tech Stack**:
- Next.js App Router for SSR performance (90+ Lighthouse score)
- Prisma ORM over Drizzle ORM (for now)
- Supabase Realtime over Firebase: Needed PostgreSQL’s row-level security
- Framer Motion for fluid transitions (key for live updates)

## The Build: Lessons from the Trenches

### Iterative Process
- Conducted 10+ user interviews
- Started with Figma prototypes testing permission workflows
- Pivoted from Firebase to Supabase after scalability stress tests

### Technical Deep Dive
```typescript
// Simplified real-time event listener
supabase.channel('messages')
  .on('postgres_changes', { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public' }, (payload) => {
    // Update UI in real-time
  })
  .subscribe();
