## Project Overview

The platform offers users a seamless way to:

- Discover Events or Moments: Explore upcoming gatherings, activities, and opportunities tailored to their interests.
- Engage in Real Time: Join live conversations, share experiences, and interact with others during events or experiences.
- Build Communities: Connect with like-minded people, creatives, and businesses to create lasting memories.

Whether it's a small local gathering or a large-scale public event, WeOuddy empowers users to share moments effortlessly. My role in this project involved crafting user flows, optimizing engagement features, and ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.
