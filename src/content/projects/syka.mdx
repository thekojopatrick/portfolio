## Project Overview

Key features of the app include:

- Effortless Money Transfers: Fast and secure remittances between Ghana and Europe.
- Quick Account Setup: Get a free bank account in just 10 minutes—no paperwork required.
- Smart Money Management: Manage your finances directly from your smartphone with an intuitive dashboard.
- Real-Time Notifications: Stay updated on transactions and account activity instantly.
- Enhanced Security: Advanced encryption ensures your money and data are always safe.

In this project, I worked on designing user-friendly interfaces, optimizing user experience transaction workflows, and ensuring the app’s usability and reliability for a seamless banking experience.
