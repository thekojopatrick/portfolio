## Project Overview

The platformâ€™s key features include:

- Affordable Pricing: Direct partnerships with local farms minimize costs, making fresh produce accessible to all.
- Convenient Delivery: Seamless delivery options cater to households, restaurants, and businesses, saving time and effort.
- Farm-to-Table Freshness: Every order supports local agriculture while ensuring customers enjoy the freshest produce.
- Sustainability Focus: Promotes locally-sourced food, reducing the environmental impact of long supply chains.

My role in this project included designing intuitive user interfaces, streamlining order workflows for efficiency, and enhancing the customer experience to ensure seamless interactions from browsing to delivery.
